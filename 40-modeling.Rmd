## Preparing for Modeling

Now we add all the features together to the dataset. The new dataset which contains all the new attributes `sup_new_feature` is created.

```{r add features to the dataset}
sup_new_feature <- supermarket %>% 
  month_detail(date, time) %>% 
  gross_item() %>%
  total_quant_day() %>% 
  price_level()
  
head(sup_new_feature)

```
