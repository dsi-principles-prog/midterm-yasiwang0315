## Preparing for Modeling

Now we add all the features together to the dataset. The new dataset which contains all the new attributes `sup_new_feature` is created.

```{r add features to the dataset}
sup_new_feature <- supermarket %>% 
  total_quant_day() %>%
 # month_detail(date, time) %>% 
 # gross_item() %>%
  price_level() %>% 
  select(total_quantity_per_day, month, day, gross_income_per_item, unit_price_level, rating, everything())

write.csv(sup_new_feature,"sup_new_feature.csv")

head(sup_new_feature)

```
